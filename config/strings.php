|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Player-visible strings

|
| The game speaks English and only English. This file replaced lang/en/*.php
| when translation was removed: there is one locale, so there is no locale to
| resolve, negotiate or switch, and nothing here is keyed by language.
|
| What belongs here is anything a player reads that is NOT attached to a
| database row. Anything that IS — an item's name, a skill's title — lives on
| the row instead, because the row already exists and a second home for half of
| its content is a second thing to keep in step.
|
| Read it with App\Support\Text, which substitutes :placeholders. Keys still
| name the ROLE of a string rather than its text, so rewording copy stays a
| one-line change here.
