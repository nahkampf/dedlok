# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.3] — 2026-09-02
### Added
- build: add bin/release script to handle versioning, changelog etc.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-09-02
### Added

### Changed
- Skill tree changed to a list with accordions. Marks which skills you have injected
  and displays current level. 

### Fixed
- Overspill from skill level breakpoints now handled correctly.
- Reflex is supposed to be a physical attribute, not a mental one. Fixed now.
- The meters on skill levels on the skill page now displays correctly.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-09-02

### Added
- Skill tree at /skills

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-02

### Removed
- Completely remove i18n. Having the game translatable at this stage is just too
  much effort and leads to weird stuff where some things live in db and some
  things in files.

### Changed
- Moved archetypes fully to db

### Migrations

- `2026_09_02_150000_remove_the_translation_layer` — adds `name` and `flavor`
  to `items` (backfilled for the seeded catalogue), drops `users.locale`.
- `2026_09_02_160000_create_archetypes_tables` — creates both tables and
  **inserts the roster**, ids preserved. Reference data whose ids are
  load-bearing has to exist the moment the schema does, so it is not a seeder.
  Clears any `characters.archetype` that names no archetype before adding the
  constraint; such a row was already broken and granted no perks.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-09-02

### Changed

- Self host **IBM Plex**. We already host Overpass, and we don't want the round-
  trip to google servers.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-02

First tagged version. Everything before this was just pushed straight onto `main`.

### Added

- There are now inventories, and `container` decides if it's a physical inventory
  or data. 
- We can now create skillbooks and inject them
- There are now container items
- /inventory is a first step

### Changed

- Items can now stack (`stack_key`).
- Increased the font-size slightly across the board

### Migrations

- `2026_09_02_120000_create_items_tables` — `items` and `inventory_items`.
- `2026_09_02_130000_add_containment_to_inventory_items` — adds `capacity` and
  `accepts` to `items`, `parent_id` and `stack_key` to `inventory_items`, and
  drops the old composite unique key.
